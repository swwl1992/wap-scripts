CSR Bot
===
Inputless automation for CSR.

### Setup

* Employement ID: `fillin.js` line 2
* URL of CSR: `background.js` line 2

### How to use

* Install the extension on your chrome.
* Fill in the working hour for *at least* one day for each month,
such that the bot can pick up a project from the lists of "recently used projects".
* Click the extension and enjoy!

### Notes

* Skipping vacations (paid leaves) is enabled.
If you wish to skip vacations,
please set "Work Name" of those days to vacation **before** running the bot.
* On a few pages the waiting time can be as long as 15 seconds.
This is a hack to wait for the rendering to complete.
